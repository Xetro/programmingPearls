# programmingPearls

My collections of solutions to exercises from Programming Pearls book. They are sorted in parts and columns as they appear in book. Each column includes README which explains the problem and our solutions.
Stored here for future reference.

Also includes some implementations of general computer science algorithms and data structures.

Code examples in C.
